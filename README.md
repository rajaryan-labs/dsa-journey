# DSA Journey

This repository contains my personal journey learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It includes implementations, exercises, and practice problems in C++.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic:

- **binary-search**: Binary search algorithms and problems.
- **linked-list**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked list implementations.
- **maths-dsa**: Mathematical algorithms.
- **oops**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++.
- **pointers**: Pointer basics and advanced usage.
- **recursion**: Recursive algorithms.
- **sorting**: Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.).
- **stack**: Stack implementation and problems.
- **stl-cpp**: Standard Template Library (STL) usage.
- **strings**: String manipulation problems.

## Goals

- Master core data structures.
- improve problem-solving skills.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
